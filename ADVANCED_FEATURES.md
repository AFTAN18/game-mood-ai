# 🎮 Advanced Game Mood Advisor - Feature Documentation

## 🚀 What We've Built

This is a **revolutionary Game Recommendation System** that goes far beyond simple mood assessment. We've implemented a **multi-parameter anger detection system** that analyzes your emotional state through multiple data points to provide incredibly accurate game recommendations.

## 🔬 Multi-Parameter Anger Detection System

### 1. **Typing Speed Analysis** ⌨️
- **Real-time WPM tracking** with baseline deviation analysis
- **Typing variance detection** to identify stress patterns
- **Accuracy monitoring** to detect frustration levels
- **Baseline comparison** against standard 40 WPM

**How it works:**
- Type the sample text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
- System tracks your typing speed, accuracy, and consistency
- Higher WPM than baseline may indicate stress or urgency
- High variance suggests inconsistent emotional state

### 2. **Click Intensity Detection** 🖱️
- **Force measurement** simulation (0-100 scale)
- **Click frequency analysis** (clicks per second)
- **Pattern recognition** (calm, normal, erratic, aggressive)
- **Position-based intensity** (edge vs center clicking)

**How it works:**
- Click in the designated area to measure intensity
- System analyzes click patterns and frequency
- Higher intensity may indicate frustration
- Rapid clicking suggests stress or impatience

### 3. **Text Sentiment Analysis** 📝
- **Advanced keyword detection** for anger indicators
- **Sentiment scoring** (-1 to +1 scale)
- **Confidence calculation** based on text length and keyword density
- **Real-time analysis** as you type

**How it works:**
- Describe how you're feeling in the text area
- System detects anger-related keywords and positive phrases
- Calculates overall sentiment with confidence scoring
- Provides detailed analysis of your emotional state

## 🧠 Anger Scoring Algorithm

### **Weighted Multi-Parameter Analysis**
```
Final Score = (Text Sentiment × 25%) + (Voice Tone × 20%) + 
              (Typing Speed × 15%) + (Click Intensity × 10%) + 
              (Game History × 15%) + (Time of Day × 5%) + 
              (Physiological × 10%)
```

### **Anger Levels & Categories**
| Anger Level | Score Range | Recommended Categories | Avoid Categories |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **CALM** | 0-20 | Strategy, Puzzle, Building, RPG | None |
| **MILD** | 21-40 | Adventure, Racing, Sports | Dark Souls-like, Roguelike |
| **MODERATE** | 41-60 | Action, Fighting, Hack-n-Slash | Competitive Multiplayer, PvP |
| **HIGH** | 61-80 | Casual, Relaxing, Sandbox | PvP, Roguelike, Competitive |
| **EXTREME** | 81-100 | Meditation, Music, Walking Sim | All Competitive Games |

## 🎯 Game Recommendation Engine

### **Smart Library-First Approach**
1. **Analyze user's installed games** first

   - Mood match score

### **Fallback to New Suggestions**
If no suitable games in library:
- **Fetch recommendations** from gaming databases
- **Add platform links** (Steam, Epic, Xbox, etc.)
- **Provide reasoning** for each suggestion
